                Accessibility is a moving target. The European Accessibility Act&apos;s requirements
                came into force in June 2025, WCAG moved to 2.2, EN 301 549 is being updated, and US
                ADA Title II deadlines were extended in 2026. You can&apos;t read one article and be
                done. So instead of asking you to track the W3C, EUR-Lex and the DOJ yourself, we do
                it, and we send you the short version.

                Monthly, plus breaking-change alerts. The monthly issue rounds up what moved. The

            These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of EAA Navigator. By using the site you
            agree to these terms.
          </p>

          <h2>Not legal advice</h2>
          <p>
            EAA Navigator provides plain-English information about web accessibility requirements,
            including WCAG, the European Accessibility Act and the ADA. This is general guidance to
            help you understand those requirements, not legal advice, and it does not create a
            lawyer-client relationship. For decisions specific to your organisation, confirm with the
            official sources we link or a qualified adviser. We cannot guarantee compliance, and you
            should be cautious of anyone, or any tool, that claims they can.
          </p>

          <h2>Accuracy and updates</h2>
          <p>
            Accessibility standards and law change over time. We work to keep the site accurate and
            to cite official sources, and we show a &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date on key pages. Even
            so, the content may not always reflect the very latest position, and where the law is
            unsettled we say so. You are responsible for checking the official sources before acting.
          </p>

          <h2>Use of the site</h2>
          <p>
            You may use the site for your own information and internal business purposes. You may not
            misuse the site, attempt to disrupt it, or use it in any unlawful way.
          </p>

          <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            The content, design and branding of EAA Navigator are owned by the publisher or its
            licensors, except for official texts and other third-party material, which remain the
            property of their respective owners. You may share short extracts with attribution and a
            link, but you may not republish substantial parts without permission.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-party links</h2>
          <p>
            We link to official sources such as the W3C, EUR-Lex, the European Commission and the US
            Department of Justice, as well as other third-party sites. We are not responsible for the
            content of external sites.
          </p>

          <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss arising from your
            reliance on the information on this site. The site is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis
            without warranties of any kind.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these terms from time to time. The &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date above reflects
            the most recent revision.
